The object description you received:
 I lost a brown bean wallet in NYC before. It has a brown belt on the right side and a light gray circle button on the belt.
My assignment reflections:
First, I searched for keywords based on the description of the object provided by Elina and found a reference for this object (wallet) on the Internet. Based on the reference and my imagination, I drew the wallet. Later, when coding, I tried to use the RGB value to find the brown color. After several attempts, I failed to find the value of brown. Later, through learning on the Internet, I learned how to adjust the value to the brown area and change the depth of brown.
